The scene Midterm is where we keep the final project. Everything is encapsulated within this one scene.

## Final Project
Shuffleboard Coaching Assistant
Play simplified shuffleboard with the Meta Oculus Quest 2. Make an L pose with your hand to make a line to the further controller. Make a right thumbs up to add a score to the right player. Make a left thumbs up to add a score to the left player. This also brings up the scoreboard with the current scores. Make a fist to turn off the scoreboard and the line detections.
